# LIRI

A node.js application which takes a command and input data, and outputs the information to the console, as well as log.txt.

LIRI can search for the following information:
- Spotify track listings, based off of an title.
- Lookup concert venues and dates for a given band.
- Lookup information about movies,  including plot, actors, ratings, and more!

## Overview
I have created functions using APIs for Spotify, OMDB, and Bands in Town to retrieve requested infomation.

I have also used the following node modules in order to accomplish this:
- axios
- moment
- node-spotify-api
- dotenv

## Installation
1. Copy the contents of the repo to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you copied the files to via Terminal/Bash.
3. run 'npm install' to install the required modules.
